# Butta Bhojanam — Thistle-inspired Next.js + Tailwind Starter

This is a **Thistle.co–inspired** landing experience, not an exact clone. It uses **Next.js (App Router)**, **React 18**, and **Tailwind CSS** with a simple API route.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Structure
- `app/` — App Router pages, global layout & CSS
- `components/` — UI sections (Header, Hero, MenuGrid, HowItWorks, Testimonials, CTA, Footer)
- `app/api/subscribe/route.js` — demo POST handler
- `public/` — placeholder images
